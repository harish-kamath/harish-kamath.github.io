Hey! I'm an undergraduate in my 4<sup>th</sup> and final year at [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu). I am pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a focus in artificial intelligence and systems architecture. I am particularly passionate about [research](/publications) and [startups](/experience) in the tech space!

###### **Research Interests:**
Generalization theory in deep learning - performance of models across changing distributions, alternatives to ERM, and the roles of sparsity and unsupervised feature learning in robust models. I find that generalization in reinforcement learning is especially interesting, due to its applications in model-based RL, sim2real, and exploration strategies.

###### **Other things about me:**
I enjoy playing & following basketball (go Hawks!), going on [runs](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6201649) & hikes, and [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/chandhoo).

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
