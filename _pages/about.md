Hey! I'm an ML Research Engineer at [Scale AI](http://www.scale.com). I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in 2021, with a dual Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am particularly passionate about [research](/publications) and [startups](/experience) in the tech space!

###### **Research Interests:**
- **Generalization Theory** - domain shifts and ERM alternatives. 
- **Reinforcement Learning** - model-based RL and exploration.
- **Graph Neural Networks** - applications to biology and physics.


###### **Other things about me:**
I enjoy playing & following basketball (go Hawks!), going on [runs](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6201649), biking, [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/chandhoo), and [dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGEAmH5qomw&t=124s&ab_channel=BollywoodAmerica)!
