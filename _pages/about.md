Hey! I'm Harish. I'm currently working on something new.

Previously, I worked on 3D computer vision and diffusion models at [Scale AI](http://www.scale.com). I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in 2021, with a Bachelor's degree in CS & Math.

###### Things I like to do:

- Go on long walks
- Anything music (I especially admire great singers)
- Learning new things
