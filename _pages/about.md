Hey! I'm Harish. I'm currently working on something new.

Previously, I was an ML Research Engineer at [Scale AI](http://www.scale.com), where I made 3D point cloud synthetic data, and image diffusion models for e-commerce companies. I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in 2021, with a Bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Mathematics.



###### **Other things about me:**
I used to dance competitively in college - see if you can spot me [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGEAmH5qomw&ab_channel=BollywoodAmerica) or [here](https://youtu.be/Uuc4cUT08yM?t=390) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGklU2__nFw&ab_channel=ParthProductions). I also play basketball (go Hawks!), go on [runs](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6201649), and play [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/chandhoo).
