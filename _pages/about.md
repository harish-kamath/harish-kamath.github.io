Hey! I'm Harish. I'm currently working on something new.

Previously, I worked on 3D computer vision and diffusion models at [Scale AI](http://www.scale.com). I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in 2021, with a Bachelor's degree in CS & Math.

I believe that AI is the most important technology that humans will ever create. I want to spend my career understanding how it works, and ensuring that it is safe and helpful to everyone.

###### Things I like to do:

- Go on long walks
- Anything music (I especially admire great singers)
- Learning new things
