Hey! I'm Harish. I'm currently working on the interpretability team at Anthropic.

Previously, I worked on 3D computer vision and diffusion models at [Scale AI](http://www.scale.com). I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://gatech.edu) in 2021, with a Bachelor's degree in CS & Math.

I believe that AI is the most important technology that humans will ever create. I want to spend my career understanding how it works, and making it useful for everyone.

I love talking to other people excited about interpretability! Please reach out to me on X if you want to chat.

###### Things I like:

- Going on long walks
- Music (I especially admire great singers)
- Active games with friends
