*NOTE: This page is still a WIP. I am actively adding new experiments and more details, but the outline and core experiments are in place. I expect to finish everything by the 17th.*

**TL;DR:** We propose a new architecture to interpret LLM representations, called RQAE (Residual Quantization Autoencoder). RQAE learns features hierarchically, by applying residual vector quantization on the residual stream of an LLM. RQAE has equivalent or better reconstruction than SAEs, with much higher capacity. We show that RQAEs are equivalent to learning meta SAEs end-to-end, and show that they greatly help solve the issue with feature splitting and absorption in SAEs. Additionally, we show how RQAE can be used in three common interpretability tasks that SAEs are used for: finding new features (i.e. dictionary learning a set of features), activation steering, and concept detection.

# Introduction

The purpose of interpretability is to decompose a deep model into human-understandable features. This has led to some incredibly interesting work: my favorites include visualizing what parts of an image a model uses to predict a class <d-cite key="gradcam" /> and seeing how RL agents identify friends and enemies in a game <d-cite key="coinrun" />.

However, Large Language Models (LLMs) may be more complicated to interpret. Text is a much denser medium than visuals when it comes to interpretable features, and LLMs are orders of magnitude larger than any other models we've ever trained. This work is heavily inspired by [transformer-circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/), which has laid out a foundation for how we can begin to interpret LLMs. If you're new to interpretability, I would recommend reading these works first, but I'll provide a quick rundown of the core concepts in this section.

Other work has explored how different layers of the LLM contribute to different functions (for example, the feedforward layers store facts that the LLM knows <d-cite key="rome" />). However, the scope of this work is limited to considering the residual stream of a LLM. In the future, we hope to extend this model to all other layers of the LLM, as has been done with SAEs <d-cite key="gemmascope" />.

## World Models

What is a human interpretable feature, and why would they exist in LLMs? Well, we know that LLMs store world models because they are *really* good at predicting the next token, and compressing the training data to the extent that they do requires some latent understanding of the world. Ha & Schmidhuber define this more rigorously <d-cite key="worldmodels" />, but roughly:
1. There are a large number of things that can and will happen in the world
2. We observe what happens, and we reason about what happens with a much, much smaller set of "latent" features.

For example, if we see someone drop a glass bottle, then we expect the bottle to shatter when it hits the ground. This is not because we have observed exactly that person dropping exactly that bottle before. It's because we have learned a very small set of latent features about physics, which we can use to model the bottle breaking.

This is exactly why LLMs are so exciting - they just don't have the capacity to store all of the knowledge that we know they have (i.e. to actually memorize the training data), which means that they must also be working with some set of latent features that they can manipulate to solve the next token prediction task!

## Linear Representations and Superposition

How do LLMs organize and use these latent features? There's a lot of evidence that LLMs describe features as simply directions in space, known as the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH). If true, it's a very powerful framework - for example, you can define a causal inner product, and show that vectors which are orthogonal to one another are also causally linked <d-cite key="lrhgeom" />.

Then, a full LLM activation is the sum of multiple atomic interpretable features. For example, we might think of a dog as the 'animal' feature plus the 'pet' feature, minus the 'feline' feature. Features also scale differently depending on the subject: a dog will have more of the 'smart' feature than a goldfish.

We formalize the LRH with the definition given [here](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/july-update/index.html#linear-representations-mathematical):
<blockquote>
<b>Definition 1:</b> A linear representation has the following two properties:

<ol style="line-height: 1em; font-size: 0.9em; margin: 1.5em 0.5em;">
  <li><b>Composition as Addition</b>: The presence of a feature is represented by adding that feature.</li>
  <li><b>Intensity as Scaling</b>: The intensity of a feature is represented by magnitude.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

There is one problem with the LRH: the residual stream of an LLM with width $d$ lies in the space $\mathbb{R}^d$. However, there can be at most $d$ orthogonal vectors in this space (any basis you choose), which means that there can be at most $d$ completely unique "feature directions".

In order for the LRH to be true, models must learn features in [superposition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html). This means that features *will* interfere with each other, and you can not fully separate feature interactions. However, you can also fit exponentially more features in a $d$-dimensional space which are only $\epsilon$-orthogonal to each other!

There's one more thing to notice about the LRH: similar features should correspond to similar directions. For example, the "dog" feature should be closer to the "cat" feature than to the "shark" feature. Thus, when measuring by cosine similarity, we should see clusters forming which correspond to similar features.

## Sparse Autoencoders

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) try to take advantage of the LRH by learning an overcomplete basis to take features out of superposition <d-cite key="sae" />. SAEs take inspiration from sparse coding theory (Chapter 7 from [Wright and Ma](https://book-wright-ma.github.io/) is a great introduction): it suggests that learning a dictionary of features that only fire sparsely (i.e. a very small number of features are required to define each activation) also results in that dictionary being human-interpretable.

<div class="caption">
    A figure taken from <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html">Toy Models of Superposition</a>. In this case, the observed model is our LLM, and the disentangled model is what we are trying to learn with a SAE.
</div>

Looking back at the [World Models](#world-models) section, this actually makes a lot of sense! We can think of the "larger" model as the set of disentangled latent variables that model the real world. Importantly, the larger model only activates sparsely - this means that any interaction only takes in a few features. Sparse autoencoders try to reconstruct this larger model, in order to move out of superposition.

<blockquote>
<b>Definition 2:</b> A sparse autoencoder $S$ of size $n$ is a model that takes in an activation $r \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and does the following:

$$
C(r) = \sigma(W_{in}r  + b_{in})
$$
$$
S(r) = W_{out}C(r) +b_{out}
$$

where $\sigma$ is some nonlinearity (usually ReLU), and $W_{out} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}, W_{in} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ (for $n \gg d$). $b_{in} \in \mathbb{R}^n, b_{out} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ are bias terms.

S is trained to recover $r$ while inducing sparsity in $C(r)$, meaning that $C(r)$ is zero in most dimensions - common methods to induce sparsity include TopK, L1 loss, or just thresholding.
</blockquote>

To explicitly draw the connection to the LRH, a SAE performs the following algorithm:

1. Begin with some entangled LLM activation $r$, and consider that $W_{in}$ consists of $n$ vectors, which we will call "probe" vectors.
2. Compare $r$ against each probe vector by calculating their dot product.
3. Add a bias to each of these dot products, because some features scale differently than others depending on their average intensities.
4. Apply a nonlinearity (usually ReLU), to act as a filter for sparsity (by dropping probes that are very unlikely to zero).
5. There are now $n$ coefficients  $C(r) = \[c_1, c_2, ...\]$, which are the intensities of each feature in $r$.
7. Multiply $C$ by the columns of $W_{out}$, which are the actual feature vectors (directions) that you have learned.

*NOTE: Notice that each (probe, feature) pair of vectors are closely linked - the cosine similarity ($\propto$ dot product) that a representation has to a probe directly defines the intensity of the feature. At the beginning of training, the encoder is initialized as the transpose of the decoder so that probes = features.*

However, an SAE can only learn a set number $n$ of features, and it's likely that $n \ll N$ for the true number of features $N$ the LLM uses. To give a toy example, let's consider there to be two "ground-truth" features $f_1$ and $f_2$ - these features are similar but not exactly the same (e.g. different breeds of dogs). How will the SAE learn these features?

## The Feature Hierarchy

The answer to the question posed above is: the model will learn an average direction that will fire weakly for these features - for example, a "dog" feature. It might also learn a few features that weakly activate for related, more general features - for example, a "living" feature, or a "pet" feature. Clearly, we want some level of control on the specificity of features that SAEs learn.

There are three widely observed issues with SAEs, that all stem from this intuition:

1. **Feature splitting**. If you train a wider SAE, you will notice that more general features split into smaller, more specific features.
2. **Feature absorption**. You learn two separate features in your SAE that are describing the same ground-truth feature - as a result, representations with that ground-truth feature are split across the two learned features without any discernable pattern (i.e. the difference between the two features is spurious).
3. **Feature shrinkage**. SAEs routinely *underestimate* the intensity of a given feature. It happens because of the sparsity penalty during training - see [this work](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes) for a clear example and more. JumpReLUs <d-cite key="jumprelu" /> largely mitigate this issue, but it's related to the first two because it happens due to learning entangled features (an SAE will underestimate a feature's intensity because it wants to account for other features that will interfere).

All three of these issues stem from the same underlying cause: SAE features are not necessarily atomic. They might need to be broken down or grouped together, but it's difficult to tell which is which, and the training objective doesn't bias the model one way or the other. This begs the question: what is an atomic feature?

A paper from UChicago attempts to answer this question <d-cite key="cathierarchy" />. They split up features in two dimensions: **hierarchical** features, such as organism -> (plant -> (tree, bush, etc.), animal -> (bird, reptile, fish, etc.)), and **categorical** features, such as (dog, cat, hamster, etc.). Hierarchical features are organized orthogonally to each other, while categorical features organize themselves into polytopes. It's not clear how *complete* this definition of features is - but we'll use this definition moving forwards, since adding hierarchy *does* define atomic features.

SAEs treats features as if they are all categorical. It *can* learn hierarchies of features (for example, it can learn separate features for organism, plant, animal, etc.) - but there is nothing in the architecture that *encourages* it to learn such features. My best guess is that it learns hierarchy based on the frequency of the concepts in the training data alone, since [this work](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2024/september-update/index.html#oversampling) finds that SAEs learn more granular features when trained on different datasets. However, this is still an open question.

## Brainstorming a New Architecture

Consider a new architecture that did learn features hierarchically. What would that look like? It should assigns features to a hierarchy, with parent and child features, such that any time a feature is activated, it's parent will also be activated, and zero or one of it's children will be activated. Then, we could address the three issues presented in the previous section:

1. If a feature splits, then we define the base feature as higher in the hierarchy, and the split features as lower in the hierarchy.
2. Feature absorption is a result of going deeper in the hierarchy than you want to. If you notice two features that should be absorbed, you should ignore them and only consider their parent feature.
3. Feature shrinkage should not happen, because features at a given layer in the hierarchy will only "compete" with other features on the same level. That is, the intensity of a parent feature shouldn't depend on the intensity of it's children, and vice versa. Since exactly one feature will be activated at each layer of the hierarchy, there is no incentive to account for interference.

# RQAE

Finally, we introduce the proposed architecture, RQAE (Residual Quantization Autoencoder). This architecture follows the model described in the previous section, and learns features hierarchically. Check out [Figure 1](#fig1) for an illustrated version.

The core idea behind RQAE is to use residual vector quantization (RVQ) to autoencode the LLM representation. If you aren't familiar with RVQ, [here](https://drscotthawley.github.io/blog/posts/2023-06-12-RVQ.html) is a great explanation. The primary difference is that we inject a linear in/out layer between each quantization step, which allows the model to iteratively choose different subspaces of the representation space to quantize.

We use a quantization variant of FSQ <d-cite key="fsq" />, that uses hyperspheres instead of hypercubes to define codebooks. There are two benefits of using FSQ:
1. There are no issues with codebook collapse. Most codebooks are utilized fully, which is especially important when we have many layers.
2. It restricts the geometry of subspaces in the representation space to ellipsoid objects only (hypersphere + affine transform). Since ellipsoids can approximate convex<d-footnote>Categorical feature polytopes don't necessarily have to be convex, so this claim is somewhat dubious - but in practice, it seems to be okay.</d-footnote> polytopes well <d-cite key="ellipsoid" />, subspaces are encouraged to take the shape of the categorical features mentioned above <d-cite key="cathierarchy" />.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    <b>Figure 1.</b> An overview of RQAE. This diagram does not include biases, which are present at each linear layer.
</div>

RQAE fits the definition from [above](#brainstorming-a-new-architecture) well. For any given LLM activation, every layer returns exactly one codebook. Later layers are dependent on earlier layers (not strictly, as we will see in [Algorithms](#algorithms)), encouraging a hierarchy between layers. We define the learned features to be the entries of the codebooks after they are projected by the linear out layer. Thus, a RQAE model with $n$ layers and $c$ codebooks per layer learns $c \times n$ unique features, but can represent $c^n$ different activations.

## A Close Resemblance to SAEs

It's hard to propose a new architecture, when the existing architecture already has a large body of work and plenty of empirical evidence (for example, Gemmascope <d-cite key="gemmascope" /> used $O($training compute of GPT-3$)$ to train SAEs). Thus, we draw a connection between the layers of a RQAE and a SAE.

Conceptually, RQAE has the same parts as the SAE algorithm mentioned [above](#sparse-autoencoders): linear in layers are "probes", groups of intensity coefficients are constrained to lie on the hypersphere, and features are the columns of the linear out layers. However, we can go a step further and show mathematically that these two are the same:

<blockquote id="lemma1">
<b>Lemma 1:</b> A single layer of RQAE can be equivalently defined as an SAE.
<br />
<b>Proof:</b> Still a WIP. Will follow <a href="https://euclaise.xyz/vq-is-mlp/">this work</a> closely
</blockquote>

In practice, notice that in [Figure 1](#fig1) we use a much smaller codebook dimension. This is needed for quantization (especially FSQ, whose codebook size grows exponentially with respect to codebook dimension). However, this is not a concern, because there is a large body of work that suggests LLM features and feature manifolds are represented in very low dimensional subspaces (i.e. rank deficiency)<d-cite key="lora" />. 

## RQAE $\approx$ Meta-SAE

[This work](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/TMAmHh4DdMr4nCSr5/showing-sae-latents-are-not-atomic-using-meta-saes) introduces meta SAEs - training a smaller SAE on top of the features learned by an existing. It's clear why this should work conceptually - an existing SAE will certainly have features with some interference (which is what causes feature splitting/absorption in the first place), so a meta SAE simply takes those features out of superposition as well. We can build on the previous [Lemma](#lemma1) to describe the meta SAE in the RVQ framework as well:

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma 2:</b> Two layers of RQAE can be equivalently defined as a meta SAE.
<br />
<b>Proof:</b> Still a WIP. General idea is that meta SAE = SAE on residuals of what SAE missed. Should be conceptually clear, since we have shown that VQ = SAE, so Meta SAE = SAE on top of SAE = VQ on top of VQ.
</blockquote>

## Design Decisions

RQAEs can be narrowly defined with the framework of SAEs given the right hyperparameters, but the actual implementation of RQAE can be very different. In this section, we'll describe notable design decision made while implementing RQAE. Here's the default model we will reference throughout the rest of the work:

| LLM | Gemma 2 2B/9B | Base model to interpret |
| Layer | Residuals after the center layer (12 for 2B, 21 for 9B) | What layer of the residual stream to train on |

<div class="caption">
    <b>Table 1.</b> Default parameter values for RQAE.
</div>

**Hypersphere FSQ:** We use a variant of FSQ, that uses hyperspheres instead of hypercubes to define codebooks. This way, the model only has one code that fully activates each feature, making it easier to interpret features individually.

**Unconstrained Decoder Norm**: Quantization doesn't have an equivalent of intensity, compared to SAEs. Thus, in contrast to SAEs, we do not restrict the decoder features to have unit weight norm.

**Normalized Activations:** Before passing the LLM activations into RQAE, we normalize them. For simplicity, we use the final RMS norm layer of the LLM. Note that this means the activations don't actually have unit norms, but rather they have the same mean and variance <d-footnote>This is different than SAEs, which normalize activations by averages over the dataset</d-footnote>. This wasn't done intentionally, but didn't seem to affect training - it's future work to investigate this further.

**Training and Test Dataset:** We use the [FineWeb-Edu dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu), because we expect the focus on educational content to allow RQAE to learn more interesting interpretable features. We use the same subset of [monology/pile-uncopyrighted](https://huggingface.co/datasets/monology/pile-uncopyrighted) that [Neuronpedia](https://www.neuronpedia.org/) uses to interpret Gemmascope features.

**128 Context Length:** We found many prior works to use this context length, but some works (notably Gemmascope <d-cite key="gemmascope" />) to use longer context lengths. We stick to 128, because it allows for faster experimentation, but we may introduce future work extending this limit. Notably, Gemmascope found that reconstruction loss is relatively constant after the first several tokens.

**1B training tokens:** Most prior work trains for longer (by 4-16x). Indeed, we do see that MSE loss is still decreasing at 1B tokens. However, the loss hits an inflection point even as early as 200M tokens (see [Figure 3a](#fig3a)), and similar to above, we wanted to prioritize faster experimentation.

<br />
<br />

For all other parameters, we provide empirical evidence in the [Ablation](#ablations) section, describing how they impact performance.

The term is called a “disjunction” and it means that something is not true. It is a term that is used in the context of a philosophy of science, and it is used to describe a situation where two things are not true.

            Let's talk about the 10th anniversary of this beautiful, wonderful series. I know that it was not on my list but if you think carefully and deeply then maybe there is a reason why we are going to discuss today one thing in particular which has been happening since last year or so...
            There have always been those who say "I don't like anything from Naruto" (which means Shippuden) because they were too young when all these things happened during their childhood days! It doesn't matter how old she gets; her work will never change for anyone else except herself alone forevermore without any explanation whatsoever either way around!! So let

            Let's talk about the topic of today. Today we are going to be talking specifically on how you can get rid of back pain and I know that this is a subject matter where there has been so much misconception, especially in our time now because people don't understand what they should do when it comes to their body issues like for example with regards to neck pains or whatever else but let us just focus upon one aspect at hand which would definitely deal directly into your spine problems here as well if only those who suffer from them could have access towards some kind off relief through any type whatsoever then maybe things might actually work out alright without being too difficult afterwards either way

            Let's talk about it.
            I was watching the first episode of season 3 and I noticed something that really bothered me, so much in fact...that is why this theory came into my mind....
            This thing happened at least three times throughout all episodes:
            And then there were these moments which are also characteristic for schizophrenia (but not only):
            The following picture shows a part with an obvious schizophrenic-like aura
            A lot can be said here but let us come to another subject - depression! The main character has been depressed since childhood because she lost her mother when young girl during some kind of accident . And now we have what you see

            Let's talk about. Now, I want to concentrate on the first part of this disorder which is called psychosis and then we will go through it all in detail now because there are some other disorders that exist like mania for example but they don’t have psychotic features associated with them so those ones would be left out here or something else might occur as well ,etc., etc.. But if you look at a person from an outside perspective without any underlying conditions such things usually happen during acute phase when someone gets affected by depression/anxiety anxiety-depression spectrum (ie depressive episodes).

            Now let me explain what i mean before going into details . So basically these symptoms
